cats demo

This a mobile demo built on Node.js, Express and Materialize.  There is no persistent storage layer. 
You will need Node.js version 5.12 or newer and NPM version 3.8.6 or newer.

The CATS (Cox Automotive Total Solutions) demo can be stood up quite easily by simply...
1. Clone this repo
2. Open a terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run `npm install`
3. The demo should now be reacheable at http://localhost:3000

Keep in mind that this is a mobile demo. To emulate a mobile experience in Chrome you can open 
the Chrome Developer Tools (Command + Option + i) and then toggle the Device Toolbar (Command + Shift + m)
